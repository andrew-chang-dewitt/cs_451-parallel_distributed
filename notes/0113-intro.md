## why parallel & distrubted matter?

not much of a motivation is needed these days given modern computing's reliance on networking multiple devices together.

examples mentioned:

- conways game of life
- llm development/running
  - typically run on GPUs using 1000s of cores, meaning workloads need split into parallel computations in order to leverage full capabilities
- cryptography (for the same reason as llms)
